# The 6 Pass: website project notes

Engineer: Ammar. Business owner: Nida (Ammar's mom, not technical). Work lives in `the6pass/`.

## Product
Premium Toronto membership. One yearly pass: two-for-one, or a free upgrade, at hand-picked restaurants, spas, yoga/pilates studios, hotel restaurants and spas, experiences. Modeled on The Entertainer, but curated.
- Premium, never Groupon. No coupons, no expiring vouchers, no fine print. "Fewer places. Better ones." "Fifty great spots beat two hundred average ones."
- 50 hand-picked Founding Partners at launch, one neighbourhood at a time.
- Core idea: bring someone, and come back. A reason to go out on a Tuesday.
- Hotels: offers on their restaurants and spas, never free room nights. Spas: free upgrade/add-on on a bigger treatment, not a full second treatment.
- Audience: 20s/30s downtown professionals (Bay Street: finance, law, consulting, Big 4). Also students and newcomers.
- Future (tone only): employer perk (Big 4, law firms, banks; LSA-paid), later a bank card. Must look credible to an HR lead. Competitor: Perkopolis (big discount catalogue); we're the opposite. NO corporate section yet; at most a quiet "For teams: hello@the6pass.ca".
- First neighbourhoods: Financial District, King West, Queen West, Ossington, Yorkville, Leslieville.

- **Never show prices until Ammar says so. Use [PRICE].** HST treatment unsettled.
- Offer rules: food, services, non-alcoholic only (AGCO). In person only. Merchant sets uses/member/year (default 2, max 12), at least 3 days/week, own days + blackouts. Pause with 7 days' notice.
- Merchant terms (recommended, not signed off): free 12 months from go-live, no commission, no per-visit fee, no setup. First 50 = Founding Partner badge, featured at launch. Never quote a year-2 price. 30 days' notice either side.

## Hard rules
- Do NOT touch the existing Netlify site `verdant-dasik-7a1dc1`, its domains, or any DNS. New site = NEW Netlify site. Ammar swaps the domain.
- Supabase: connect, never change. Never delete/alter/migrate `public.waitlist` or its policies. Schema change ideas: write SQL, ask first. Never use or commit a service role/secret key.
- No alcohol anywhere (offers, images, copy).
- No invented stats, member counts, testimonials, reviews, press logos, or real business names/logos. Fictional names only.
- Copy: plain, warm, short sentences. No em dashes. No hype words ("revolutionary", "unlock", "elevate").
- Accessible: real labels, visible focus, 4.5:1 contrast, reduced motion. Lighthouse 90+ mobile.
- Copy that changes (FAQ, offers, owners, launch date) lives in ONE content file. Explain Netlify/GitHub steps as exact clicks.
- Avoid stock AI looks: dark bg + one red/acid accent, cream + terracotta + serif, purple gradients, Inter/Space Grotesk, emoji, everything centered, identical rounded cards with accent bars.
- Commit as you go.

## Supabase
- URL https://nefnflqknwubmurjzqll.supabase.co, region Canada (Central).
- Publishable key (public): `sb_publishable_xTQU4mZ_6iQU1VTo_3-Y2A_Kxg_k-z8`. Put in `.env.local` + Netlify env vars, not hardcoded.
- `public.waitlist`: id bigint identity, email text not null (unique on lower(email)), first_name, neighbourhood, consent bool, consent_text, source, campaign, created_at default now().
- RLS: anon INSERT only when consent = true and email length 5..254. No public SELECT.
- Insert: `POST /rest/v1/waitlist`, headers `apikey`, `Content-Type: application/json`, `Prefer: return=minimal`. No `Authorization: Bearer` with sb_publishable keys. 409 = duplicate: show "You're already on the list."

## Waitlist spec
- Inline form + popup (after ~5s or 45% scroll; snooze 3 days on close; never after joining; Esc, close button, focus trap, phone-friendly).
- Fields: email (required), first name, neighbourhood (optional). UNTICKED consent checkbox required, exact label (CASL): "Yes, email me about The 6 Pass launch and founding member pricing. I can unsubscribe any time." Save as consent_text verbatim.
- source = utm_source, else referrer host, else "direct". campaign = utm_campaign.
- States: inline errors, loading, success, already-on-list.

## Existing copy to keep/improve
- "Toronto, two for one." / "One yearly pass. Two-for-one at hand-picked restaurants, spas, studios and more across the city. Bring someone, and come back."
- Offers: Restaurants "Second main, on us." Spas "A free upgrade on your treatment." Yoga and studios "Bring a friend to class, free." Caption "Example offers. Each partner sets its own."
- How it works: 1 Get your pass. 2 Pick a spot (offer, days, how many uses). 3 Show your code (tap Redeem, staff confirm, second one is on the house).
- Owners: "We're choosing 50 Founding Partners. Free for your first 12 months, and you set the offer, the days and the limits." hello@the6pass.ca

## Stack
Next.js (App Router, TS), Tailwind, static-first. New Netlify site. Footer: The 6 Pass, Toronto, ON, hello@the6pass.ca, privacy, terms, @the6pass.

## Status
